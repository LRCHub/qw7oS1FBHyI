Never grow up

I'm never gonna grow up
If I'm alive tomorrow I'll still be a screw up
A young heart can be in a grown man
But they cant well change who the fuck I am
They can have their suits, they can have their ties
I'll be in there yelling with my boys rolling dice
Fun and games and it ain't gonna change
Until the day that I die
But I ain't done with this life
I'm having fun with this life

Everyday bullshit ain't for me
I live young I live free
Never be what they want me to be
I'm too happy being me (Never grow up)
Never gonna settle down like the rest
If life's a game, if life's a test
Well then you gotta cheat death
Until your last fuckin breath (Never grow up)

Everyday bullshit ain't for me
I live young I live free
Never be what they want me to be
I'm too happy being me (Never grow up)
Never gonna settle down like the rest
If life's a game, if life's a test
Well then you gotta cheat death
Until your last fuckin breath

Never grow up

When I walk down the street
Everywhere I look all I seem to see
Nothing but fuckin salvies
Who forget about their dreams
Jaded as fuck down on their luck
Still trying to work out just where they fucked up
Fuckin slaves with a foot in the grave
They're too late to be saved
I don't ever wanna be that way
That'll never be the path I take

They say you're only young once
Well I say fuck that
I'm never gonna grow up
Young at heart until the day I die
Who's fuckin with me?

(Never grow up)
Everyday bullshit ain't for me (Never grow up)
I live young I live free (Never grow up)
Never gonna be what they want me to be (Never grow up)
I'm too happy being me (Never grow up)
Never gonna settle down like the rest (Never grow up)
If life's a game if life's a test (Never grow up)
Well then you gotta cheat death (Never grow up)
Until your last fucking breath (Never grow up)
