They say:
Hey whadaya doin' with your life
Why don'tcha settle down and find yourself a wife
Don't you know you can't run away from here
When will you act your age, why don't you listen dear

I say:
I'll never grow up
I'll never grow up
I'll never grow up now

They say:
You better stop your dreamin'
You're goin' nowhere fast
What if we throw you out
How long you think you'll last
When will you go to school, why don'tcha get a job
Hey girl you better shape up, you're lookin' like a slob

Well i say:
I'll never grow up
I'll never grow up
I'll never grow up now
And i say it again
I'll never grow up
I'll never grow up
I'll never grow up now

I can't believe you can't hear what you're saying
Take a good look at yourself
Why don'tcha listen to the music we're playing
Go pick on somebody else

They say:
You think that life's a free ride
Well take a tip from me
We're gonna end your party
With some responsibility

Everybody say:
I'll never grow up
I'll never grow up
I'll never grow up now
Oh i know you can do better than that
Everybody sing
I'll never grow up
Gimme me more
I'll never grow up
Gimme more
I'll never grow up now
Gimme, gimme, gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme
I'll never grow up
Hey you in the back
I'll never grow up
Yeah you
Don't just stand there sing along
I'll never grow up now
Everybody
I'll never grow up
C'mon now
I'll never grow up
I'll never grow up now
Whoopee!
I want my mother
I'll never grow up
I'll never grow up
What are all these people doin' in my room
I'll never grow up now
Get off my bed
Hey watch it you're crushing my dresser
I'll never grow up
What's that midget doin' here
I'll never grow up
I'll never grow up now
