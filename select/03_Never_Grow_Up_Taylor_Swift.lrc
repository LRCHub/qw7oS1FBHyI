[00:15.48] Your little hands wrapped around my finger
[00:18.60] And it's so quiet in the world tonight
[00:23.25] Your little eyelids flutter cause you're dreaming
[00:26.05] So I tuck you in, turn on your favorite night light
[00:31.15] To you everything's funny, you've got nothing to regret
[00:39.35] I'd give all I have honey
[00:43.38] If you could stay like that
[00:56.88] 
[00:46.02] Oh darling, don't you ever grow up
[00:49.32] Don't you ever grow up, just stay this little
[00:53.93] Oh darling, don't you ever grow up
[00:56.98] Don't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple
[01:02.33] I won't let nobody hurt you, won't let no one break your heart
[01:10.30] And no one will desert you
[01:14.52] Just try to never grow up, never grow up
[01:34.52] 
[01:32.23] You're in the car on the way to the movies
[01:35.58] And you're mortified your mom is dropping you off
[01:39.87] At 14 there is just so much you can't do
[01:42.85] And you can't wait to move out someday and call your own shots
[01:47.69] But don't make her drop you off around the block
[01:51.53] Remember that she's getting older too
[01:55.37] Don't lose the way that you dance around in your pj's getting ready for school
[02:34.37] 
[02:02.76] Oh darling, don't you ever grow up
[02:06.15] Don't you ever grow up, just stay this little
[02:10.93] Oh darling don't you ever grow up
[02:13.85] Don't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple
[02:19.74] And no one's ever burned you, nothing's ever left you scarred
[02:27.11] And even though you want to, just try to never grow up
[02:54.11] 
[02:41.56] Take pictures in your mind of your childhood room
[02:49.27] Memorize what it sounded like, when your dad gets home
[02:55.41] Remember the footsteps, remember the words said
[02:59.78] And all of your little brother's favorite songs
[03:04.65] I just realized everything I have is someday gonna be gone
[03:33.65] 
[03:12.21] So here I am in my new apartment
[03:15.53] In a big city, they just dropped me off
[03:19.81] It's so much colder than I thought it would be
[03:23.17] So I tuck myself in and turn my night light on
[03:46.17] 
[03:33.49] Wish I'd never grown up
[03:40.29] I wish I'd never grown up
[03:52.79] 
[03:42.59] Oh I don't wanna grow up, wish I'd never grown up
[03:48.02] I could still be little
[03:50.63] Oh I dont wanna grow up, wish I'd never grown up
[03:55.68] It could still be simple
[04:07.68] 
[03:58.55] Oh darling, don't you ever grow up
[04:01.24] Don't you ever grow up, just stay this little
[04:06.10] Oh darling, don't you ever grow up
[04:09.09] Don't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple
[04:14.82] Won't let nobody hurt you
[04:18.78] Won't let no one break your heart
[04:22.55] And even though you want to, please try to never grow up
[04:29.42] Oooh, don't you ever grow up
[04:38.31] Oooh, just never grow up
